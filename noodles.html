    <p>
      Cold buckwheat noodles are a popular dish in Asia, especially in Korea and
      Japan. Naeng momil origins come from Japanese zaru soba and the two are
      very similar.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>Â½ leek</li>
        <li>Â½ onion</li>
        <li>1 tsp ginger</li>
        <li>1 cup light soy sauce</li>
        <li>Â½ cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup sake</li>
        <li>1 sheet kombu</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>Â½ cup bonito flakes</li>
        <li>100g daikon radish</li>
        <li>2 tsp wasabi</li>
        <li>1 scallion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>200g soba</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Char the leek and onion until itâ€™s blackened and blistered. Use a blow
          torch or put under broiler settings on your oven. This process helps
          give the broth a smoky and deep flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the leek and onion to a pot. Add ginger, soy sauce, sugar, sake,
          kombu, and water. Reserve the kombu for later!
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn the heat on high and until the mixture starts to bubble. Lower
          the heat to a simmer and reduce the broth for 20 minutes or until the
          onions and leeks have turned translucent and let out their flavors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn the heat off and add the bonito flakes. Let it steep in the
          residual heat for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Strain the broth. Cool the mixture down and set it aside in a fridge.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Assembly</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Grate the daikon radish. If you donâ€™t have a grater, use a food
          processor or a blender. Add a little water to help it blend easier.
        </li>
        <li>
          Strain the daikon by squeezing out the liquid with your hands. Form
          into small balls.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook the soba noodles according to package directions. PRO TIP: The
          noodles will boil over if left unattended! Have a jug of cold water
          ready next to the pot so that when it starts foaming and rising you
          can add a dash of cold water to bring the water down.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drain the noodles and wash the noodles under cold water. This process
          prevents the noodles from cooking further and allows them to retain a
          springy and chewy texture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour Â½ cup of broth for each person. Add equal parts ice to the broth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the grated radish and wasabi to your liking to the broth. Start by
          putting Â½ tbsp of grated radish in the broth first and see!
        </li>
        <li>
          Dip your soba noodles into the concentrated broth. Slurp and enjoy ðŸ™‚
